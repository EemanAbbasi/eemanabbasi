# About
I am deeply passionate about exploring the cutting-edge field of ecological medicine, driven by a desire to develop innovative and integrative solutions for complex biomedical challenges. My journey began with a double major in Computer Science and Biological Sciences during my bachelor's degree, where I cultivated a strong foundation in both disciplines.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Microbial Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania. My research is fueled by a fascination with the intricate relationships between the host immune response, diet, and the microbiome. By leveraging mathematical and computational models alongside advanced bioinformatic pipelines, I aim to uncover the profound impacts these factors have on human health and disease.

Through my work, I aspire to contribute to a deeper understanding of host-microbiome interactions, paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in ecological medicine and ultimately improving human well-being.
